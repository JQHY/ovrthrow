# oVRthrow

Welcome to oVRthrow's repository! oVRthrow is a VR fitness game inspired by Atari's Rampart arcade game.

Prepared by Jonathan Yeap, Isaac Ray, Ben Belay and Chris Stuttard.

## Overview

The directory 'OVRTHROW Source Files' contains all the source code to run the project in Unity. This can then be used to make Unity Builds.

If you want to quickly run the game, you can unzip OVRTHROW_BUILD.zip, and run the OVRTHROW.exe application. For more information, see the "Quick start guide" in "Ovrthrow User Manual.pdf".

## Setup & Requirements

oVRthrow is built for SteamVR, and was developed using the Quest 2 and Oculus Link. SteamVR also makes the game compatible with a large range of Virtual Reality headsets, and there is a full list of these in Section 2.2 of the user manual. Note that all of these headsets (with the exception of Quest 2 via AirLink) must be connected to the PC via a cable. To run this application on your PC, install the latest available version of SteamVR. The best way to install SteamVR as a user is through the Steam launcher. Please see section 2.2 of the user manual for a step-by-step guide for setting up.

## Game menu

When you first load the game, you will have to calibrate your height, and then be greeted by the main menu. Here you can change the game difficulty or watch the tutorial. Hit play to run the game. 

## Gameplay

The game lasts five rounds.

Each round of the game consists of three phases; attack phase, repair phase and repair phase. The duration of these are 60 seconds, 30 seconds and 20 seconds. 

In the attack phase, you must throw cannonballs using a kettlebell swing to destroy the enemy castle. Cannonballs are picked up by holding the grip buttons on your VR controllers. Meanwhile, enemy cannons will be firing at your castle, and causing you damage.

The repair phase follows, where you must try to repair your castle walls. Damaged walls will be highlighted in green, and turning to face them will select them in blue. You must then hold your trigger buttons and make a squat, to repair each selected wall piece. Particle animations of bricks will appear to show you are making a repair!

The rest phase simply allows you to catch your breath, before another round starts.

The more damage you can do to the enemy, and the more walls you can repair, the more points you earn! However, you will also lose points if you don't repair your walls. Try to beat your highscore!

## Features in development

The game currently has no Watson speech commands. We have implemented Watson SDK in Unity, and successfully made some voice commands work, however this isn't yet stable enough to add to the game. To see how far we implemented Watson, and what features we were planning to use it for, see Section 3.5 of the user manual.

There is also yet to be music and sound effects in the game.
