# oVRthrow

Welcome to oVRthrow's repository! This project was prepared by Jonathan Yeap, Isaac Ray, Ben Belay and Chris Stuttard, and we are Durham's Group 26 Software Engineering team. 

The 'OVRTHROW Source Files' directory contains all the source code to run the project in Unity. This can then be used to make Unity Builds.

You can also run a Unity Build of the project directly by unzipping OVRTHROW_BUILD.zip, and running the OVRTHROW.exe application. For more information, see the "Quick start guide" in "Ovrthrow User Manual.pdf".
